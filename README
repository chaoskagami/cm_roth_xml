* WARNING - Build currently broken. It was fine until I put this up, I swear. Sync'd repos are unable to build.

This is a project to port CyanogenMod to the Nvidia Shield
(nvidia-roth target.) Right now it's very incomplete, and
probably 90% unusable.

I'm aiming for 100% source usage, aside from graphics. No
precompiled apks or kernels - unlike that one xda project
which was a vanilla kernel. Nvidia has provided more
than enough for this task to be possible.

Usage
-------------------------------
 * Install the build requirements. Obviously.
 * Sync cyanogenmod's source code. Add the xml
   to local manifests.
 * . build/envsetup
 * setpaths
 * lunch full_roth-eng
 * (optional) export OUT=...
 * make -jX
 * cd $OUT
 * fastboot flash ...
 * Done

What is done
-------------------------------
 * Recovery image builds, and boots. We can mount stuff
   and use adb shell.

What is broken
-------------------------------
 * In recovery, screen is sideways. Shield is physically
   unable to rotate, I need to build a fix in. However,
   despite head-turning, it's working.

What currently needs to be done
-------------------------------
 * Build an entire system.img to see how/if it works.
