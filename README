* WARNING - Build currently broken. It was fine until I put this up, I swear. Sync'd repos are unable to build.
* EDIT    - I'm going to investigate this soon - unfortunately I'm out of HD space (240GB ssd) and my
*           desktop is rendered unbootable from the latest kernel update to gentoo (idk why)
*           I'll solve the desktop issue soon but for now it sits

This is a project to port CyanogenMod to the Nvidia Shield
(nvidia-roth target.) Right now it's very incomplete, and
probably 90% unusable. (scratch that, unusable. period.
for now at least)

I'm aiming for 100% source usage, aside from graphics blobs
if necessary. No precompiled apks or kernels - unlike that
one xda project that added root which was a vanilla kernel.
Nvidia has provided more than enough for this task to be
possible, albeit frustrating.

Usage
-------------------------------
 * Install the build requirements. Obviously.
 * Sync cyanogenmod's source code. Add the xml
   to local manifests.
 * . build/envsetup
 * setpaths
 * lunch full_roth-(eng | userdebug | user)
 * (optional) export OUT=...
 * (optional) ccache setup?
 * make -jX
 * cd $OUT
 * fastboot flash ...files...
 * Done

What is done
-------------------------------
 * Recovery image builds, and boots. We can mount stuff
   and use adb shell.

What is broken
-------------------------------
 * In recovery, screen is sideways. Shield is physically
   unable to rotate, I need to build a fix in. However,
   despite head-turning, it's working. Just a pain.

What currently needs to be done
-------------------------------
 * Build an entire system.img to see how/if it works.
 * I may have done stuff against the wrong branch.
   cm-jb apparently =/= cm-10
